I wanted to learn their business, their problems, opportunities, and the people behind. \n\nToday I'm fortunate to combine all my learnings when assisting companies who are venturing into the digital world. Together we design the details of new (digital) products or services. From here on, I help turn these dreams into practical and pragmatic executable steps. \nI believe strongly in putting good values upfront; solid business will flow naturally from it. In every step I ask myself the question; does it add value. Will it make the users, the customers â€¦ the life of people better and more enjoyable.",
